# calculator

A simple calculator app that uses javascript to recreate the feeling of a physical calculator with buttons and a screen.

This project required considerable thought into some of the logic behind the calculator and particularly how the entries needed to be stored in variables and accessed at the right times by the operators to perform the calculations.

The project was finished with some quick and simple css, using grid, flexbox and a color scheme to represent a traditional calculator.
